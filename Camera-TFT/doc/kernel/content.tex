\section{Description}
The procedures described in this document prepare the Raspberry Pi so that it
can interface with the camera and the TFT LCD touchscreen.

\section{Setup}
A set up script is provided at \texttt{../../scripts/setup/kernel\_setup.sh} to
ease the building and installation.

If the setup script finished successfully; a new kernel should be installed and
the system configuration to be able to interface with the camera and the TFT LCD
touchscreen should have been taken care of.

\section{Testing}
No test script is provided for this setup. The testing is conducted together
with the testing of the \textbf{fbcp} application. Please refer to the
\textbf{fbcp} configuration documentation (\texttt{../fbcp/report.pdf}) for
more information on this point.
